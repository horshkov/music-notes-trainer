This signals that Solana is evolving beyond just a meme coin platform and becoming a major hub for decentralized Bitcoin trading. Its fast speeds, low fees, and improved user experience are driving a shift away from ETH-based BTC trading. The surge in volume also suggests potential involvement from institutions or whales. Solana is now gaining real traction and positioning itself at the center of the next phase of crypto market infrastructure.",

But one thing keeps bugging me, and I’d love to hear the community’s perspective.\n\nIf I use Bitcoin to buy something — say a coffee — that’s considered a disposition of an asset by the CRA here in Canada. That would trigger a capital gains tax, depending on what I originally paid for that BTC. That’s not how spending actual money works — I don’t pay capital gains when I use fiat at a store.\n\nSo here’s my question:\nIf Bitcoin is truly money, shouldn’t it be treated like money from a tax perspective too? The way things are now, it feels like the system is pushing people not to use it in daily life.\n\nIs this just a growing pain until tax laws catch up? Or is this part of the trade-off we accept in exchange for having money the state can’t manipulate?",
