This is my first time posting here.\n\nI've been really enjoying the js/ts ecosystem lately,.\nI'm usually used to Java/Kotlin with Spring Boot, and one thing I've been missing is the actuators.\n\nSo I've searched for a package that is easy to configure, extensible, and can be used regardless of the frameworks and libraries in any project, and couldn't find one that suited what I wanted.\n\nSo I decided to just rewrite my own.\n\nYou can find it here:\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/@actuatorjs/actuatorjs\n\nFor now, I've abstracted the HealthCheck part of actuators, and I like what I got going so far.\n\nIt can be used by any framework, server, and basically nodejs compatible runtime (I personnaly use bun, bit that's irrelevant).\n\nI gave a basic example of an express app, using postgres as a database, but I'm soon going to expand on example.\n\nIt has 0 dependencies, 100% written in TypeScript and compiled to be used even with common js (for those of you who might have legacy code).\n\nI'm also planning many small packages, such as a postgres one for a pre-defined healthcheck using pg's client, and many more, as well as framework support to easily add routes for express, hapi, fastify, bun, etc.\n\nIt'll be fairly simple and minimal, and you would only need to install what you use and need to use.\n\nAnd for my curiosity, how do you guys handle nodejs' application in containerized environnement like Kubernetes, specifically, readiness and liveness probes.\n\nI couldn't find anything good in that regards as well, so I might start expanding it on my actuators.\n\nFor the interested, my stack to develop it is the following:\n- Bun\n- Husky for git hooks\n- Commitlint\n- Lint-staged\n- Bun's test runner\n- Biome as a formatter/linter\n\nThe code is open source and copy left, so feel free to star, fork, and even contribute if you'd like:\nhttps://github.com/actuatorjs/actuatorjs",

      "selftext": "Hi folks—Erik here, author of `typescript-result` \n\nI just cut a new release and the headline feature is **generator support**. Now you can write what *looks* like ordinary synchronous TypeScript—`if/else`, loops, early returns—yet still get full, compile-time tracking of every possible failure.\n\nThe spark came from **Effect** (fantastic framework). The `function* / yield*` syntax looked odd at first, but it clicked fast, and now the upsides are hard to ignore.\n\nI’ve been using Result types nonstop for the past year at my current job, and by now I can’t imagine going without them. The type-safety and error-handling ergonomics are great, but in more complex flows the stack and nesting of `Result.map()`/`recover() / etc` calls can turn into spaghetti fast. I kept wondering whether I could keep plain-old TypeScript control flow—`if/else`, `for` loops, early returns—*and* still track every failure in the type system. I was also jealous of Rust’s `?` operator. Then, a couple of weeks ago, I ran into Effect’s generator syntax and had the “aha” moment—so I ported the same idea to `typescript-result`.\n\nExample:\n\n    import fs from \"node:fs/promises\";\n    import { Result } from \"typescript-result\";\n    import { z } from \"zod\";\n    \n    class IOError extends Error {\n      readonly type = \"io-error\";\n    }\n    \n    class ParseError extends Error {\n      readonly type = \"parse-error\";\n    }\n    \n    class ValidationError extends Error {\n      readonly type = \"validation-error\";\n    }\n    \n    const readFile = Result.wrap(\n      (filePath: string) =&gt; fs.readFile(filePath, \"utf-8\"),\n      () =&gt; new IOError(`Unable to read file`),\n    );\n    \n    const parseConfig = Result.wrap(\n      (data: unknown) =&gt;\n        z\n          .object({\n            name: z.string().min(1),\n            version: z.number().int().positive(),\n          })\n          .parse(data),\n          (error) =&gt; new ValidationError(`Invalid configuration`, { cause: error }),\n    );\n    \n    function* getConfig(filePath: string) {\n      const contents = yield* readFile(filePath);\n    \n      const json = yield* Result.try(\n        () =&gt; JSON.parse(contents),\n        () =&gt; new ParseError(\"Unable to parse JSON\"),\n      );\n    \n      return parseConfig(json);\n    }\n    \n    const result = await Result.gen(getConfig(\"config.json\"));\n    // Result&lt;Config, IOError | ParseError | ValidationError&gt;\n\nSkim past the quirky `yield*` and read `getConfig` top-to-bottom—it feels like straight sync code, yet the compiler still tells you exactly what can blow up so you can handle it cleanly.\n\nWould you write code this way? Why (or why not)?\n\nRepo’s here → [**https://github.com/everweij/typescript-result**](https://github.com/everweij/typescript-result)  \nGive it a spin when you have a moment—feedback is welcome, and if you find it useful, a small ⭐ would mean a lot.\n\nCheers!  \nErik",

So I’m stuck with a single bundle that needs to work everywhere.\n\nSo far I’ve:\n\n* Upgraded Node to v18\n* Enabled tree-shaking\n* Tried generating a flame graph, but since the project is huge, it was so complex that I could barely even understand it\n\nWhat else can I do to make it *blazingly fast* and reduce the bundle size further? Any tips or best practices would be much appreciated!",

So, I've never needed it. But lately, I've been TIRED of my dead-end K-12 tech job (don't get me wrong, I love tech, but the job I have in particular is dead-end and pays minimum wage; I don't even get paid during the summer so I currently have no income), and so I've been searching for development jobs. I am being a tad picky, because my fiance and I want to move and we'll need income while doing that, so I was hoping to find remote development work--I don't care if it's front end, back end, or full stack--and I just can't seem to find any listings that I feel even confident enough to apply for, despite knowing that I can still \"get sh\\*t done\". Just... not the way companies would want? \\[Anyway, I'd prefer to have a remote position which makes it even more difficult\\]\n\nBasically, I've scoured WeWorkRemotely, Subreddits, Indeed, and other places--to no avail. Everyone either wants \"senior\" developers \\[seriously, where the hell are all of the entry and intermediate level jobs? With my skill-set, I could probably easily land an intermediate position for full-stack, but senior? Even if I know the techs, I don't have the \"on paper\" experience to back it up\\], and/or they want React or some other framework.\n\nI totally understand why, but also, I don't. I feel completely useless knowing these numerous languages and techs when they get me absolutely nowhere with job hunting. For context, these are the languages and techs I'm familiar with:\n\n\\- HTML/CSS (OBVIOUSLY, this goes without saying for anyone doing web dev)\n\n\\- Tailwind, SCSS \\[and by extension, SASS\\]\n\n\\- JavaScript, TypeScript (I use JQuery in most of my front end projects, as well; I realize this is outdated, but makes things SO much quicker with the projects I build)\n\n\\- NodeJS, and numerous packages/apps; also, web frameworks such as Express and Fastify\n\n\\- Other languages/etc: Python, Java, PHP--I've also DABBLED in Kotlin.\n\n  \nI dunno, it just feels useless knowing all of these things if I'm missing just that ONE key component. I feel it's a bit ridiculous that I need to spend the time to learn YET ANOTHER framework or library just to even have a chance at landing any sort of job in that arena.",

      "selftext": "A sample of improvements\n\n- type / typeid equivalence: it's possible to use a constant typeid instead of type in a lot more places now, requiring fewer typeid -&gt; type conversions, which improves readability.\n- `$evaltype` which turned a string into a type now merged into `$typefrom` which is the one that turns a typeid into a type.\n- Type inference through `&amp;&amp;` (taking a reference to a temporary), allowing `Foo* f = &amp;&amp;{ 1, 2 }`.\n- Compile time \"sprintf\" for formating strings at compile time.\n- Arithmetic operator overloading now accepts macros with untyped \"wildcard\" arguments.\n\nThe full list of changes:\n\n### Changes / improvements\n- `$typefrom` now also accepts a constant string, and so works like `$evaltype`.\n- `$evaltype` is deprecated in favour of `$typefrom`.\n- Literal rules have changed, this makes `-0xFF` now a signed integer.\n- Implicitly convert from constant typeid to Type in `$Type` assignment, and `$assignable`.\n- Make $Type parameters accept constant typeid values.\n- Deprecate `foo.#bar`.\n- Allow inference across `&amp;&amp;` #2172.\n- Added support for custom file extensions in project.json targets.\n- `$eval` now also works with `@foo`, `#foo`, `$Foo` and `$foo` parameters #2114.\n- `@sprintf` macro (based on the `$$sprintf` builtin) allows compile time format strings #1874.\n- Improve error reports when encountering a broken \"if-catch\".\n- Add printf format to `$assert` and `$error` #2183.\n- Make accepting arguments for `main` a bit more liberal, accepting `main(int argc, ZString* argv)`\n- Make `$echo` and `@sprintf` correctly stringify compile time initializers and slices.\n- Add `--sources` build option to add additional files to compile. #2097\n- Support untyped second argument for operator overloading.\n- The form-feed character '\\f' is no longer valid white space.\n- Show code that caused unreachable code #2207\n- Allow generics over distinct types #2216.\n- Support distrinct types as the base type of bitstructs. #2218\n- Add hash::sha512 module to stdlib. #2227\n- Compile time type assignment (eg `$Foo = int`) is no longer an expression.\n- Add `@allow_deprecated` attribute to functions to selectively allow deprecated declarations #2223.\n- Improve error message on pointer diff #2239.\n- Compile-time comparison of constant vectors. #1575.\n- $member.get supports bitstructs.\n- $member.set for setting members without the *&amp; trick.\n- Initial support for #1925, does not affect C compilation yet, and doesn't try to link etc. Using \"--emit-only\"\n\n### Fixes\n- `-2147483648`, MIN literals work correctly.\n- Splatting const slices would not be const. #2185\n- Fixes to `$define` handling of binary ops.\n- Fixes methodsof to pick up all sorts of extension methods. #2192\n- `--lsp` sometimes does not emit end tag #2194.\n- Improve Android termux detection.\n- Update Android ABI.\n- Fixes to `@format` checking #2199.\n- Distinct versions of builtin types ignore @operator overloads #2204.\n- @operator macro using untyped parameter causes compiler segfault #2200.\n- Make `unreachable()` only panic in safe mode.\n- `cflags` additions for targets was not handed properly. #2209\n- `$echo` would suppress warning about unreachable code. #2205\n- Correctly format '%c' when given a width. #2199\n- Fix to `is_array_or_slice_of_char` #2214.\n- Method on array slice caused segfault #2211.\n- In some cases, the compiler would dereference a compile time null. #2215\n- Incorrect codegen if a macro ends with unreachable and is assigned to something. #2210\n- Fix error for named arguments-order with compile-time arguments #2212\n- Bug in AST copying would make operator overloading like `+=` compile incorrectly #2217.\n- `$defined(#expr)` broken with binary. #2219 \n- Method ambiguity when importing parent module publicly in private submodule. #2208\n- Linker errors when shadowing @local with public function #2198\n- Bug when offsetting pointers of large structs using ++ and --.\n- `x++` and `x--` works on pointer vectors #2222.\n- `x += 1` and `x -= 1` works propertly on pointer vectors #2222.\n- Fixes to `x += { 1, 1 }` for enum and pointer vectors #2222.\n- Linking fails on operator method imported as `@public` #2224.\n- Lambda C-style vaargs were not properly rejected, leading to crash #2229.\n- Incorrect handling of constant null fault causing compiler crash #2232.\n- Overload resolution fixes to inline typedef #2226.\n- `math::overflow_*` wrappers incorrectly don't allow distinct integers #2221.\n- Compiler segfault when using distinct type in attribute imported from other module #2234.\n- Assert casting bitstruct to short/char #2237.\n- @tag didn't work with members #2236.\n- Assert comparing untyped lists #2240.\n- Fix bugs relating to optional interface addr-of #2244.\n- Compiler null pointer when building a static-lib with -o somedir/... #2246\n- Segfault in the compiler when using a bitstruct constant defined using a cast with an operator #2248.\n- Default assert() message drops parens #2249.\n\n### Stdlib changes\n- Deprecate `String.is_zstr` and `String.quick_zstr` #2188.\n- Add comparison with `==` for ZString types.\n- `is_array_or_slice_of_char` and `is_arrayptr_or_slice_of_char` are replaced by constant `@` variants.\n- `@pool` now has an optional `reserve` parameter, some minor changes to the temp_allocator API\n- io::struct_to_format now supports bitstructs.\n- Add `String.escape`, `String.unescape` for escaping and unescaping a string.\n",

The design is outdated, and honestly, it's just hard to use. They haven't added any new features at all, even basic stuff like half-star ratings or a \"did-not-finish\" status, no matter how many readers ask. \n\nEvery week, someone posts on r/books, \"Goodreads is terrible. What can I use instead?\".\n\nIt was obvious Amazon had no intention of fixing it, so a year ago I said, “fuck it, I’ll do it myself.”  \n  \nToday, Kaguya's live. It has everything Goodreads does, plus more: book lists, a powerful browse page with a lot of filters, and beautiful reading stats. All inspired by my favorite media-tracking sites: Letterboxd and Anilist.

Easily create simple local graph, **no sign-up required**.\n2. Create nodes and edges. Color-code nodes and edges.\n3. Customize the text inside your nodes using rich text editor.\n4. Group nodes in blocks and label those groups.\n5. Use private-first approach: work on your own, share a read-only link with others.\n6. Invite collaborators to brainstorm together in realtime and then publish your graph publicly.\n\nEverything is free for now, I don't have a monetization plan yet.\n\nIn past I've shared what **Contextual** means in this app, so  in upcoming month I'm going to work on adding variables/parameters for both nodes and edges.\n\nYou can see my total scope of work here in [Graphito's Official Roadmap](https://graphi.to/g/38e89dd5-c063-4af5-b573-c942e541ff0f).

The results were really good and required little follow-up prompts. I didn't want to maintain a server and handle deployments, so this was the best choice.   \n  \nThere was one little problem though - I wasn't able to access these tools on my phone. This was increasingly becoming a bigger issue as I moved more and more of my tools to this format. \n\n**So I came up with** [**https://htmlsync.io/**](https://htmlsync.io/)  \n  \nThe way it works is very simple:  you upload a HTML file, that uses localStorage for data and get a subdomain URL in the format {app}-{username}.htmlsync.io to access your tool and data synchronization is handled for you automatically. You don't have to change anything in your code. \n\nFor ease of use, you even get a Linktree-like customizable user page at {username}.htmlsync.io, which you can style to your liking. \n\nI am of course biased, but I really like creating tools that work 100% the way I want. :) \n\nHope you will give it a try.

I have been working with React for more than a year now and I am still looking for a job in the market but after building a couple of projects with React I personally think its over engineered. Why do I need to always use a third party library to build something that works? And why is Next.js a defacto standard now. Im learning Next.js right now but I don’t see any use of it unless you are using SSR which a lot of us dont. Next causes more confusion than solving problems like why do I have think if my component is on client or server? I am trying to explore angular or vue but the ratio of jobs out there are unbalanced.

After thinking and overthinking, and saying maybe this week's not the right time, I finally feel confident to show off on a Saturday!\n\nI wanted to build a good social login system, where clicking on “Sign in with…” buttons will NOT quietly hand over email addresses, capture behavioural data, and more.\n\nI wanted something easy but extremely secure and private, so I built **Qrogin**: a privacy-first social login system with QR-and-passkey support/combination that gives control to users and is easy to implement for developers.\n\nQrogin is now in **beta**, and here’s what it offers:\n\n    •Two-layer passkey login, verified by email and scoped to the specific domain\n    \n    •Cross-device login/ same device login using a one-time QR code or secure link(button)\n    \n    •No passwords, no trackers, and no hidden analytics\n    \n    •Masked or hashed email addresses by default\n    \n    •Minimal data retention, designed for full GDPR compliance\n    \n    •Accessible by design, to support users with dyslexia, autism, or cognitive fatigue\n\nLink: [https://qrogin.com](https://qrogin.com)\n\nIt works through a clean JavaScript SDK or API. No third-party dependencies, no surprise popups, no dark UX tricks.\n\nThe WordPress plugin is on the way, but you can already use Qrogin right now in any npm-based project or custom frontend (npm package for the widgets-https://www.npmjs.com/package/qrogin. We also have a referral programme for developers who are building with ethics in mind.\n\nTo see it in action, sort of a demo, you could try logging in (or qroging in) on our other image aesthetic quality analysis app-https://picpulse.nkchakshu.com/login\n\nIf you’re working on something that deserves better than Big OAuth, I’d love your feedback. All opinions/suggestions are welcome! Thanks!\n\n[Example of QROGIN's social login widget currently available on npm](https://preview.redd.it/r6myf3ri08bf1.png?width=672&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c2a2f008f0e36b0c7bad3e85bd541226d2a933a)\n\n",

I've been doing a ton of research on frameworks and could really use some community wisdom.\n\nMy journey started with **Next.js**, the obvious choice. However, I've become hesitant after reading about its perceived bloat, the increasingly blurry line between client and server components in the App Router, frequent breaking changes, and the recent critical security vulnerability.\n\nI also explored **SvelteKit**. While the syntax is elegant, I'm concerned about the smaller ecosystem and the risk of hitting a wall if a key library I need doesn't have good Svelte support.\n\nThen I stumbled upon **TanStack Start** (currently in beta). It's been getting positive comments on Reddit, and after spending an afternoon with the docs, it just *clicks* with me. It perfectly matches what I'm looking for:\n\n* It uses **React**, which has a massive ecosystem.\n* It has a **clear and clean separation** between frontend and backend logic.\n* The API feels intuitive with **minimal \"magic.\"**\n* It's designed for **easy serverless deployment.**\n\nThe only catch is that it's still in beta. So my question is: for my first serious web project, am I being reckless by choosing a beta framework over an established giant like Next.js?\n\nWhat would you do in my position? Has anyone here actually used TanStack Start for a real project yet? Appreciate any and all perspectives!",

To make integration easy, I’ve published a simple **npm package** with React widgets that let you drop this login flow into your app in just a couple lines.\n\n**NOTE: We have a community plan to allow for developers to integrate QROGIN within their projects.**\n\n**npm package**:  \n[https://www.npmjs.com/package/qrogin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qrogin)\n\nThis package gives you:\n\n* Prebuilt React widgets for QR login, secure one-time link, or both\n* Clean fallback when QR expires, with auto refresh options\n* Cross-device or same-device login flows\n* No trackers, no password fields, no SDK bloat\n* Email addresses are masked or hashed by default\n* Minimal retention and full GDPR awareness baked in\n* Accessibility by design to help users with dyslexia, autism, or fatigue\n\nThese widgets are designed to work with the **QROGIN** system and can be easily dropped into any React project. You’ll need to register on [https://qrogin.com](https://qrogin.com) to generate API keys and access the login system.\n\nLive example:  \n[https://picpulse.nkchakshu.com/login](https://picpulse.nkchakshu.com/login)\n\nThe system is now in **beta**, and I would love **feedback from anyone building with modern React stacks, kiosk apps, or anything user-facing where login privacy matters.**\n\nThanks for checking it out.

Unlike generic chatbots, this one reads uploaded business documents and provides contextual responses.\n\n**The Problem:**\nMost chatbots are either rule-based (limited) or use generic AI (unhelpful). Customers ask “What are your check-in hours?” and get “I’m sorry, I don’t have that information.”\n\n**My Solution - Intelligent Knowledge Retrieval:**\n\n**Tech Stack:**\n\n- Backend: NestJS + TypeScript\n- Database: MongoDB (conversations) + Supabase (file storage)\n- AI: OpenAI GPT-4 + Embeddings API\n- Processing: Background jobs with cron scheduling\n- File Parsing: pdf-parse + mammoth for document extraction\n\n**Architecture Overview:**\n\n1. **Upload Pipeline**: PDF/DOC files → Text extraction → Chunking → Vector embeddings\n1. **Smart Retrieval**: User question → Vector similarity search → Relevant context\n1. **AI Generation**: Context + conversation history → GPT-4 → Intelligent response\n\n**Key Technical Challenges Solved:**\n\n**1. Background Processing**\n\n- Cron jobs process uploaded files every 5 minutes\n- Queue management prevents duplicate processing\n- Status tracking: pending → processing → completed/failed\n\n**2. Vector Search Implementation**\n\n- 1000-character chunks with 100-character overlap\n- OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 for embeddings\n- Cosine similarity with 0.7 threshold\n- Fallback to text search if vector search fails\n\n**3. Context Management**\n\n- Maintain conversation history (last 10 messages)\n- Combine relevant chunks into coherent context\n- Source attribution for transparency\n\n**Performance:**\n\n- Response time: 2-6 seconds (including AI generation)\n- Concurrent processing: 5 files simultaneously\n- Search accuracy: 85%+ relevance with proper knowledge base\n\n**Lessons Learned:**\n\n1. **Chunking strategy matters** - Sentence boundary detection prevents cut-off context\n1. **Fallback mechanisms are crucial** - Vector search can fail, always have text search backup\n1. **Rate limiting is essential** - Both for AI APIs and user experience\n1. **Background processing scales better** - Don’t process files synchronously\n\n**Results:**\n\n- 90% reduction in “I don’t know” responses\n- Contextual answers about business hours, amenities, policies\n- Source tracking shows which documents contributed to responses\n\nThe system now powers customer support for hospitality businesses, automatically learning from their uploaded manuals and FAQs.\n\nHappy to answer technical questions about implementation!\n\n**GitHub:** (keeping private for now)\n**Demo:** Available on request",

It is not just another wheel, but a new development experience built on top of proven design concepts:\n\n# Inheriting the Classics, Surpassing the Traditional\n\nMetis UI is constructed based on Ant Design's battle-tested component logic, ensuring consistency and reliability in interaction patterns. At the same time, we have abandoned traditional CSS-in-JS solutions and fully embraced Tailwind CSS, bringing developers unprecedented styling freedom.\n\n# Ultimate Development Experience\n\n    import { Button, Input, Form } from 'metis-ui';\n    \n    // Simple API, powerful features\n    &lt;Button \n     type=\"primary\" \n     className=\"hover:scale-105 transition-transform\"\n    &gt;\n      Custom styles, made easy\n    &lt;/Button&gt;\n\nNo need to learn complex theme configurations—just use Tailwind classes for instant customization.\n\n# Technical Highlights\n\n# 1. Perfect TypeScript Support\n\n    interface ButtonProps {\n     type?: 'primary' | 'default' | 'dashed';\n     size?: 'small' | 'middle' | 'large';\n     loading?: boolean;\n     ...\n    }\n\nEvery component comes with complete type definitions, making your development process safer and more efficient.\n\n# 2. Deep Tailwind CSS Integration\n\n    &lt;Button className=\"bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-600 hover:from-blue-600 hover:to-purple-700\"&gt;\n     Gradient Button\n    &lt;/Button&gt;\n\nLeverage the power of Tailwind to easily achieve complex styling effects.\n\n# 3. Documentation-Driven Development\n\n* 📝 Detailed API documentation\n* 🎮 Interactive code examples\n* 🌐 Multi-language support\n* 📱 Mobile-friendly browsing experience\n\n# Getting Started\n\n# Installation\n\n    # npm\n    npm install metis-ui\n    \n    # pnpm (recommended)\n    pnpm add metis-ui\n    \n    # yarn\n    yarn add metis-ui\n\n# Configuration\n\nAdd a `u/plugin` to your entry CSS file to import Metis UI.\n\n    u/import 'tailwindcss';\n    \n    u/source './node_modules/metis-ui/es';\n    @plugin 'metis-ui/plugin';\n\n# Usage\n\n    import { Alert } from 'metis-ui';\n    \n    const App = () =&gt; (\n      &lt;div className=\"h-screen w-screen\"&gt;\n        &lt;Alert type=\"info\" banner message=\"Hello\" description=\"Welcome to metis-ui\" /&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n    );\n    \n    export default App;\n\n# Theme Customization\n\nMetis UI only customizes themes for colors. By default, it provides two themes: `light` and `dark`. You can also create your own custom themes or modify the built-in ones.\n\nYou can add parentheses after `@plugin \"metis-ui/plugin\"` in your CSS file to manage themes. [See details](https://metisui.com/docs/theme-cn).\n\n# Metis Plus - Enterprise Admin System Template\n\nWe provide a ready-to-use enterprise admin system template, built with [React](https://react.dev/), [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/), [faker-js](https://fakerjs.dev/), [MSW](https://mswjs.io/), and more. It comes with out-of-the-box data flow, internationalization, menus, mock data, permission management, theme switching, and other features to help enterprises quickly build high-quality admin applications.\n\n    ├── .husky                     # Husky hook config\n    ├── public                     # Public static assets\n    ├── src                        # Source code\n    │   ├── apis                   # Server API requests\n    │   ├── assets                 # Static assets (images, SVGs, etc.)\n    │   ├── components             # Common components\n    │   ├── hooks                  # Custom hooks\n    │   ├── layouts                # Page layout components\n    │   ├── locale                 # i18n resources\n    │   ├── mocks                  # Mock data and services\n    │   ├── pages                  # Page components\n    │   ├── store                  # Zustand state management\n    │   ├── types                  # TypeScript type definitions\n    │   ├── utils                  # Utility functions and classes\n    │   ├── loading.tsx            # Global Loading component\n    │   ├── main.tsx               # App entry file\n    │   ├── routes.tsx             # Route and menu config\n    │   └── vite-env.d.ts          # Vite env type declarations\n    ├── .env                       # Environment variables\n    ├── .lintstagedrc              # lint-staged config\n    ├── .prettierignore            # Prettier ignore config\n    ├── .prettierrc                # Prettier formatting config\n    ├── commitlint.config.js       # Commit message lint config\n    ├── eslint.config.js           # ESLint config\n    ├── index.html                 # Project entry HTML\n    ├── package.json               # Project dependencies and scripts\n    ├── tailwind.css               # TailwindCSS global styles\n    ├── tsconfig.app.json          # TS app config\n    ├── tsconfig.json              # TS root config\n    ├── tsconfig.node.json         # TS Node config\n\n# Official Resources\n\n* [Official Website](https://metisui.com) \\- Full documentation and examples\n* [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/metisjs/metis-ui) \\- Source code and issue tracking\n* [Metis Plus](https://plus.metisui.com) \\- Enterprise admin system template\n* [Metis Plus GitHub Repository](https://github.com/metisjs/metis-plus) \\- Enterprise admin system template",

I created a new sub-dashboard from an existing dashboard and I used most of the components (graphs, sidebar, tables, layout etc.) that was used for creating the old dashboard to create my new sub-dashboard. The issue that I'm having is that, after taking out the things that I don't need from the \"Sidebar\" component of the new sub-dashboard, whenever I navigate through the remaining components (which are the components that I need) on the \"Sidebar\" of my new sub-dashboard, I can still see the links/components that I don't want on those current component's page. For example, I have an old dashboard (Dashboard A) which has 5 components on it's sidebar; Apple, Orange, Mango, Banana and Grapes with respective links routed to those components from the app's App.jsx component. The new sub-dashboard (Dashboard B) has only 3 components; Apple, Orange and Mango on it's own sidebar but when I navigated to (for instance the: \"myApp/apple\") endpoint for the Apple component on my new sub-dashboard, I can still see all the links/components that I have taken out from the new sub-dashboard's sidebar on the (\"myApp/apple\") page. My question is, how can I take out sidebar components/links from individual pages of my new sub-dashboard from a React app? Also, how is \"Sidebar\" most likely added to individual components/pages in most React apps? Sorry for a long post, and thanks in advance for any help.",

One of them was a web app that had multiple chat rooms and you could join and chat or file share with others in that chat room it was also possible to make private rooms if I remember correctly.    I've been trying to find a link to that site and or project since then and can't for the life of me figure out how I found it.  \n\nAnyone have an idea what I'm talking about?",
